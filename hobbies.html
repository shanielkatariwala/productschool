         <p> 
         I have been a fan of fitness my entire life. The interest sparked me when I started playing little league football and has carried with me through today.
         I am fortunate enough to have amassed enough knowledge to make fitness choices which has truly changed my life for the better.

         <p> I got the opportunity to play football at Miami University.</p>
